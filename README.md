Source repo of a class project + website about environmental justice

### Important Files
- data_manip.ipynb is where the data from data.census.gov was inputted and manipulated to then be fed into map-making tools, resulting in interactive graphs.
- index.html is where the code for the website itself is located
- All .csv and .xlsx files are either the data downloaded or the data modified and then saved - if the file name contains "fips" then it is post-manipulation data.
