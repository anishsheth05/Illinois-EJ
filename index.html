    <p style="margin: auto; width: 50%;"><br>Looking at the graphs above that both show non-white population and African-American population,
      as well as the below graph showing where Superfund sites are located, there is a visible correlation between the location of superfund sites and race.
      The more diverse locations, especially the Chicagoland area, seem to also have the greatest amount of Superfund sites, demonstrating environmental injustices.
      Specifically, to the lower-middle an area of increased diversity seems to line up with superfund sites in both Madison and Montgomery County. Vermillion County
      and Winnebago County also demonstrate this trend. Additionally, after looking at median income, it is clear that income is not the main reason for the given
      trend, as even higher-income counties have quite a few superfund sites, once again visible looking at the Chicagoland area. This points to race being even more
      of an issue, since even with higher income having highly diverse areas correlates with superfund sites. Clearly, having the wrong skin color can leave you
      breathing the wrong air or drinkning the wrong water.<br>
      While not the ultimate evidence of environmental injustice, that superfund sites exist and are not being taken care of properly in Illinois is an
      issue not only close to home, but requiring immediate solutions. The environment may adapt, but when it comes to Superfund levels of pollution, the
      impact is likely to include disturbance to water supplies and the local ecosystem, which can be disastrous. Ultimately, these injustices close to home
      are something us residents of Illinois must advocate for change in, and as soon as possible.</p>

    <p style="margin: auto; width: 50%;"><br>This website was put together by yours truly, Anish Sheth. (I'm a CS major, so it is definitely major-relevant, though I don't usually work with websites,
      so it took some time.) For one reason or another, finding all the datasets and then putting together the code to easily manipulate the data was a real pain. You can look through the code files
      <a href="https://github.com/anishsheth05/Illinois-EJ">here</a>, but rest assured that it took several hours to process the data and then interactively
      plot the data. I find myself with a newfound respect of academia and anyone who works to visualize data. Either way, I choose this format because not only was it
      major-relevant and an interesting project, but working with interactive data visualization and maps is something I have personally wanted to do for a long time.
      This project gave me the opportunity to stretch my brain and learn how to do so. In terms of how the work I did addresses EJ, I believe that this page compiles
      data that is generally hard to find in one place, such as the neat comparison between superfund sites, income, and the local racial composition. (I would have
      made the median income map interactive and more up to date, but I had trouble finding data that I could translate into a map.) Additionally, I picked
      Illinois specifically since it is something that the class has talked about, as well as because I am from here. The other reason is that interactive maps
      of the entire United States were seriously lagging my computer and ultimately proved impossible, though I did try! Perhaps a later date. Ultimately, I
      wanted to make clear that Illinois has its fair share of environmental and racial problems, and that fixing them is relevant to us all.</p>
